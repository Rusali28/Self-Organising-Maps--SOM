# Self-Organising-Maps--SOM

Self Organising Maps(SOM) belong to the Unsupervised Deep Learning category. It is an unsupervised neural network that reduces the input dimensionality in order to represent its distribution as a map. Therefore, SOM forms a map where similar samples are mapped closely together.
